 * This file creates the live directive resolver function. This runs when a field is marked

 * layer with a reference to the subscriber of the data. In the event that data has changed,
 * the data is updated in the reactive data layer and the subscribers are added to the
 * notification queue.
 *
 * @param {Function} resolve - The resolver of the field this live directive is attached to.
 * @param {Object} source - The resolution object return from the previous resolver.
 * @param {Object} args - The arguments passed into the directive. E.g. comments @live(id: "123").
 * @param {Object} context - The context object passed in when the server is created.
 * @param {Object} info - Object that stores GraphQL query info.
