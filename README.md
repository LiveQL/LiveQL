# LiveQL
LiveQL is a library for implementing live queries in GraphQL. We're currently in beta, so use with caution. 

It can be difficult to maintain live data in a GraphQL application. There are a couple common strategies. You can request updates from your server at some specified interval (polling). You can use the built in GraphQL subscription operation with WebSockets, or you can implement some other form of pub/sub. There are pros and cons to both, but there are times when neither are a great option. 

LiveQL is most simlar to the subscription model. In fact, it is the subscription model. The difference is that instead of subscribing to events that change data, you subscribe directly to the data. This means that regardless of how the data changes, youâ€™re application can maintain state.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
